JS ScummVM
----------

A native JavaScript implementation of [ScummVM](http://scummvm.org).

Progress
========

Currently I focus on running Monkey Island 1 (CDROM version,
Scumm 5.x engine). Support for other games may be added at
a later time.

Usage
=====

Copy the Monkey Island game files (monkey1.000 and monkey1.001)
to games/monkey1 and open index.html in Safari or Chrome.

Credits
=======

Most of the code is directly ported from ScummVM's C++ code base, see
[the ScummVM README](http://scummvm.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/scummvm/scummvm/tags/release-1-1-1/README?view=markup)
for full credits.

stream.js is based on the stream implementation of [gordon](http://github.com/tobeytailor/gordon/) by Tobias Schneider.
