JS ScummVM
----------

A native JavaScript implementation of [ScummVM](http://scummvm.org).

Progress
========

Currently I focus on running Monkey Island 1 (CDROM version,
Scumm 5.x engine). Support for
other games may be added at a later time.

Usage
=====

Copy the Monkey Island game files (monkey1.000 and monkey1.001)
to games/monkey1 and open index.html in Safari or Chrome.
