  I merged all the scripts into 1. sorry about that, I needed to be able to jump from function to function and variable to see everything and the functions that reference them all at once. 

  Also, check out "https://github.com/BLooperZ/nutcracker", I may use some of their code as well for the scumm script version(s) I'm trying to get this to.

    ScummVM.load("monkey1"); //might make html drop down list of games later, look into possibly loading game files directly from the internet archive.org.
